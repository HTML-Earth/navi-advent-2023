# Na'vi Advent Calendar 2023
This is a collection of interactive exercises that are intended to teach the Na'vi Language. It was made to be a small part of an advent calendar daily challenge in 2023 on the Kelutral Discord server.

This project uses Unity `2022.3.6f1` and might rely a bit too much on scriptable objects :P
